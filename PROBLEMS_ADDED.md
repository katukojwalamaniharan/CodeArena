## Features:

### For Each Problem:
✅ **Multiple examples** with explanations  
✅ **Constraints** clearly defined  
✅ **Test cases** (visible + hidden)  
✅ **Starter code** in Python/JavaScript/Java/C++  
✅ **Time & memory limits**  

### Testing:
- **Run Code**: Tests against 1 visible test case
- **Submit**: Tests against ALL test cases (including hidden)
- **Hidden tests**: Students can't see input/expected output (just like LeetCode!)

---

## Easy to Extend:

The problems follow a consistent structure, making it easy to add more. Each problem includes:

```typescript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  difficulty: 'Easy' | 'Medium' | 'Hard',
  description: string,
  examples: [...],
  constraints: [...],
  testCases: [...],  // Some marked as isHidden: true
  codeTemplates: [...],
  timeLimit: number,
  memoryLimit: number
}
```

---

## Random Selection:

Every time a user creates/joins a room, they get a **random problem** from this collection, ensuring variety and preventing memorization.

---

## Future Additions (Ready to Add):

### Medium Problems:
- 3Sum
- Product of Array Except Self
- Container With Most Water
- Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
- Group Anagrams

### Hard Problems:
- Trapping Rain Water
